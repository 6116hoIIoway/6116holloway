The first problem that I had to overcome was trying to find a good username and one that I would remember.The initial one I tried to use was 'osc_palominoâ€™ but there couldn't be any alphanumericals. Also at the end of the lesson I had trouble locating my work on my google drive. It happened to be that google drive hadn't recognised that i wanted the work in my drive and just saved it to the cloud so when I tried to access it at home I may not have been able to access the files at home </td>
