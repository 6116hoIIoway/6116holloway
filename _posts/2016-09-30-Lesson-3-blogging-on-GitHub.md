    <td>The things that have limited my learning is that I had forgotten everything that I had previously learnt in previous lessons. Also but just focusing on certain parts of my website. For example I tried to find a good background for a lot of the lesson. In the end my coding didn't go as planned and that took a while to fix. In the end I finished with a GIF as a Background.</td>
