    <td>I learned mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration and realised that my github blog doesn't just have to be black and white.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was that someone in the other classroom had forgotten their password and tried logging in a hundred times and in the end it locked out the School's IP address so it took a while before I could log in and start my work. Another problem i had to overcome was picking the right colours that go together.</td>
