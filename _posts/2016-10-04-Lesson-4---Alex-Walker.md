    <td>Mr Tansley took over today and he taught us the art of 'The Google Sheet.' I could tell that he was very passionate, yet I could also tell that he was also a beginner, like me. I asked Mr Tansley questions about things I could do with my Google Sheet. Including ‘How do I embed this onto my Github blog?’ The answer being ‘I am not sure, but I will try to find out for you.’

However I was eager to know so I took matters into my own hands and did a quick Google search and I found the answer I was looking for. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was the fact that I didn’t think about things myself. By this I mean that I copied Mr Tansley’s working instead of stopping and thinking about it myself. Next time this would definitely be something I would want to improve on for next time. </td>
