    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a virtual shop on google sheets that has various items and that has the cost to make, sale price and profit on it.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I mainly learnt by watching the demonstration shown to us by our teacher and when I got stuck on something I would ask our teacher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning is that I helped a few people who were having problems with their work. If I hadn't have done this then I may have completed more work and made my shop have more functions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to spend less time helping people and try to complete the task to the fullest.</td>
