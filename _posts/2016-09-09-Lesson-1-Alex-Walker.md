    <td>I wrote notes on my Ipad so that when I got back to work I remembered what I needed to do. I listened to how to do the task at hand and I completed it.</td>

    <td>I think that other people asking me questions about what they needed to do limited my learning. I need to work on usernames and passwords that are easily rememberable.</td>

    <td>Next time I will sit next to people who can listen and do not ask me questions that have just be answered. I will try to work more independently.</td>
