    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>In year 8 we looked at changing Binary numbers to Denary numbers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To change Denary numbers to Binary and vice versa and also changing them into Hexadecimal and vice versa.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I learnt how to quickly change Hex to Binary</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by practising and listening to my teacher who was teaching us 'shortcuts' for changing denary to binary or hex.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was that in my head I thought changing binary to denary and vice versa was quite easy and I rushed the answers and got a few wrong.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
