  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using logical thinking because if a program is wrong then you need to restart and try and get it right again, so if possible before running my program I would quickly check if it was right then made any changes if needed.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
