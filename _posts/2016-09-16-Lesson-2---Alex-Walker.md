    <td>I had to remember how Github worked from last week as I had forgotten. However I listened to the talk that are second teacher gave and understood the value that Css brings to the website.

Testing out methods that I wasn't sure were going to work but in the end it all turned out well.</td>

    <td>A numpty in the other room had forgotten his password and had tried it hundreds of times. In the end he locked the school's IP address and I started writing my blog so I didn’t have to do it for H/wk/ :-)

Next time I shall log into Github as soon as I get into school so that I don't get locked out.</td>
