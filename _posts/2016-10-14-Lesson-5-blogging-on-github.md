    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I knew how to implement tables into my website but I hadn't previously been able to implement them. For the Transparency and Shadows I had no knowledge.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a very nice website aesthetically.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I believe my website looks quite nice.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I mainly learnt by asking my classmate who had already made a drop shadow to teach me how to make one. This is the same for the transparent background.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning is that I had no idea how to accomplish what I wanted to add to my website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to go onto W3schools to have a vague idea of what I would like and how to accomplish it.</td>
